# HTA-NRM

HTA-NRM is a hierarchical framework for visual brain decoding that aligns neural activity with multi-level semantic representations derived from pretrained vision–language models. The approach emphasizes hierarchy-aware alignment and topology-informed regularization to enhance robustness and semantic consistency of learned neural representations.

This repository contains a research-oriented implementation. Full reproducibility details will be released in a subsequent version.
