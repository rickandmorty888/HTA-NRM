# HTA-NRM
HTA-NRM is a hierarchy-aware framework for visual brain decoding. It aligns fMRI signals with multiple semantic abstraction levels from pretrained vision–language models, using contrastive learning and topology-guided regularization to improve representation stability, semantic discriminability, and cross-subject robustness.
